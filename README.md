# Goodreads API GraphQL Wrapper

A GraphQL wrapper for the Goodreads REST API.

For now it's just in an early development stage. My plan is to cover all features in the orginal [Goodreads API](https://www.goodreads.com/api/index).

Feel free to contribute, report issues, request new features. Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Fvaco/goodreads-graphql-wrapper/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) to know more.
